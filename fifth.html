    <p class="fg">The fifth generation computer was based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and that is still in the developing stage. The fifth generation computer has been introduced with the aim of developing devices which have the ability to think, learn, and make decisions. The aim is to enable computer to take genuine I/O, to understand natural language and to have intelligent processing. Thus, this computer will be totally different, totally novel, and totally new than the last four generations of computers. These computers will be able to converse with people and will be able to interact in human sense, manual skills, and intelligence. For this, the concept of Artificial Intelligence is being used.</p>
    <p class="fg">Researchers are planning to produce biochip that is to be used in the fifth generation computer. While a true fifth-generation computer is not available, computer scientists are implementing the fifth generation concept on fourth generation computers. Among the developed countries, Japan has chosen the PROLOG (Programming in Logic) language as its operating software and plans to have the final machine talk with human beings, see and deliver pictures (it has image processing capability), and hear the normal natural language. Presently, Japan and the USA have undertaken projects to design such computers that are used in the field of medicine, treatment planning, monitoring, on a very small scale.</p>

    <h2 class="fgh2">Features of Fifth Generation Computers:</h2>
    <ul class="ulfg">
      <li>Technology to be used: These machines will incorporate Bio-chip and V VLSI (Very Very Large Scale Integration) or Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI).</li>
      <br>
      <li>These will use superconductor technology with little or no resistance greatly improving the speed of information flow. For that, the two future devices are used: Gallium Arsenide and Biochips.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The computers will have AI (Artificial Intelligence).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Natural language will be used to develop programs. They are intended to be able to cope with large subset of natural languages, and draw on very large knowledge bases.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Intelligent Knowledge-Based System (IKBS) are the central elements of fifth-generation computers. The computers will based on the KIPS (Knowledge based Information processing system).</li>
      <br>
      <li>The computers will have parallel processing in full fledge.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The operating speed will be in terms of LIPS (Logical Inference per Second) for knowledge based processing and femtoseconds range or above, TIPS for other data.</li>
      <br>
      <li>These are aimed to be able to solve highly complex problems, which require great intelligence and expertise when solved by people.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Quantum computation, molecular and nanotechnology will be used completely.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fg">The fifth generation computers are expected to completely transform the way humans interact with machines. With advanced AI, natural language processing, and powerful knowledge-based systems, these computers aim to perform tasks that require human-like intelligence. Their ability to learn, reason, and make decisions will make them useful in fields like medicine, research, robotics, and expert systems.</p>

    <h2 class="fgh2">Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="fg">In conclusion, fifth generation computers represent a major leap in technology. By combining AI, biochips, superconductors, and natural language abilities, they aim to create machines that can truly think and interact like humans. Although still developing, these computers hold the promise of solving complex problems and shaping the future of science, communication, and everyday life.</p>
