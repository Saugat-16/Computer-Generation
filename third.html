    <p class="fg">The development of Integrated Circuits (IC) signaled the beginning of the third generation.Transistors were replaced with integrated circuit known popularly as chips. Scientists managed to fit many components on a single chip; as a result, computers became ever smaller as more components were squeezed on the chip.IC was first designed and fabricated by Jack S. Kilby at Texas Instruments and by Robert S. Noyce at Fairchild independently. Integrated Circuit is a circuit consisting of a large number of electronic components placed on a single silicon chip by a photolithographic process.</p>
    <p class="fg">Magnetic disks began to replace magnetic tape for auxiliary and video display terminals were introduced for the output of data. Keyboards were used for the input of data. A new operating system was introduced for automatic processing and multiprogramming.The size of the main memories reached about four megabytes. These computers were highly reliable, relatively inexpensive, and faster. High-level programming languages continued to be developed.</p>

    <h2 class="fgh2">Features of Third Generation Computers:</h2>
    <ul class="ulfg">
      <li>Technology used: IC (Integrated Circuit).</li>
      <br> 
      <li>Operating speed was in terms of nanosecond range.</li>
      <br>
      <li>High level languages like FORTRAN, BASIC and others are used to develop programs.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Primary memory used: Semiconductor memory like RAM and ROM.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Secondary memory used: Magnetic disks like floppy disk, hard disk and magnetic tape.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Monitors and keyboards were introduced for data input and output respectively.</li>
      <br>
      <li>A multiprogramming facility was developed.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Database Management System was developed.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Computers were used in census calculation, military, banks and industries.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Size, cost, power requirement, heat generation decreased.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Processing speed, storage capacity, use of computer increased.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fg">During the third generation, computer technology advanced rapidly with the use of Integrated Circuits. These computers became smaller, faster, and more reliable than previous generations. Memory capacity increased and new operating systems supported multiprogramming. High-level languages became widely used for software development. Popular third-generation computers included IBM 360 series, PDP-8, PDP-11, CDC 6600, and others, which were applied in business, industry, science, and government sectors.</p>

    <h2 class="fgh2">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="fg">The third generation marked a major milestone in computer evolution. With the use of Integrated Circuits, computers became smaller, faster, cheaper, and more efficient. This generation laid the foundation for modern computing by improving memory, processing speed, and software development, making computers more accessible and practical for a wide range of applications.</p>
