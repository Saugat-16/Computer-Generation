    <p class="fg">The fourth generation of computers began with the remarkable invention of the microprocessor chip, a breakthrough that revolutionized computer technology. With MSI advancing to LSI, VLSI, and ULSI, thousands of integrated circuits could be embedded onto a single tiny chip. Semiconductor memories replaced older magnetic core memories, making computers faster, smaller, cheaper, and far more efficient. In 1971, the American Intel Corporation introduced the first microprocessor, the famous Intel 4004, which significantly influenced the direction of computing. As a result, fourth-generation computers became more powerful, reliable, and capable of handling complex operations for personal, commercial, and industrial use.</p>
    <p class="fg">
    This computer has faster processing and processing speed and increased memory capacity. These features made the fourth-generation computers more powerful and reliable.
    High-level language and application software for microcomputers became popular and allowed home and business users to adapt their computers for word processing, spreadsheet manipulating, file handling and graphics.</p>

    <h2 class="fgh2">Features of Fourth Generation Computers:</h2>
    <br>
    <ul class="ulfg">
    <li>Technology in use: VLSI is introduced and used. Microprocessor based technology.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Programming languages: High level programming language (HLL) used to develop programs.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Primary memory in use: Semiconductor memories like RAM, ROM and cache memory.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Secondary memory in use: Memory chips, hard disk, optical memories like CD, DVD, Blu-ray flash memory.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Flexible input devices like mouse, touch screen, scanner and output devices like LCD, LED monitor.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Microcomputers like desktop PC, laptop, tablet PC are developed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Computers could be linked together and share information. E-mail the Internet, and mobile applications are developed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Advanced user friendly web based software is developed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Operating speed, storage capacity, use of computer increased compared to previous generations.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Size, cost, power requirement has generation decreased compared to previous generations.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <p class="fg">During this generation, computers started using advanced technologies such as VLSI microprocessor-based systems and high-level programming languages for software development. Semiconductor memories like RAM, ROM, and cache became the primary storage, while hard disks and optical media such as CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and flash memory emerged as secondary storage options. Input and output devices also improved, with the introduction of touch screens, scanners, and LCD/LED monitors. Microcomputers such as desktop PCs, laptops, and tablets grew in popularity. The rise of the Internet, e-mail services, and mobile applications enabled computers to share information globally. Operating speeds increased dramatically, storage capacities expanded, and computers became smaller, cheaper, and more energy-efficient. This generation also saw the development of user-friendly web-based software and the rise of computer networking and CD-ROM technology.</p>

    <h2 class="fgh2">Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p class="fg">The fourth generation marked a turning point in the history of computing, transforming bulky machines into powerful, portable, and affordable tools for daily life. With the introduction of microprocessors, semiconductor memory, advanced input/output devices, and global networking, computers became widely accessible and highly efficient. This period laid the foundation for modern digital technology, shaping the computers we depend on today, such as IBM-PCs, HP laptops, and Mac Notebooks, and paving the way for the intelligent systems of the future.</p>
