    <p class="fg">The first generation computers operated on the principle of thermionic emission. They used Thermionic valves also known as vacuum tubes as processor or main technology, magnetic drum for data storage, and machine language was used for giving instructions. The first generation computers used the stored-program concept. The computers of this generation were very large in size called mainframe or room sized computers. Their programming was difficult and time consuming. The programming of first generation computers was done in machine language (instructions were written in binary digits 0s and 1s). Afterward assembly language (programs were written in mnemonics) was developed and used in first-generation computers.</p>
    <p class="fg">
    John Von Neumann designed a computer called EDVAC with the architecture of CPU; which allowed all computer functions to be coordinated through a single source. Lee De Forest invented vacuum tubes in 1908.John Von Neumann’s EDVAC architecture introduced the stored-program concept. Vacuum tubes, invented by Lee De Forest in 1908, made these early computers possible.

    <h2 class="fgh2">Features of First Generation Computers:</h2>

  <ul class="ulfg">
  <li>Technology used: Vacuum tube</li>
  <br>
  <li>Operating Speed was in terms of milliseconds range.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Machine language was used to instruct the computer. Programming mainly at the hardware level.</li>
  <br>
  <li> Primary memory used: Magnetic core memory</li>
  <br>
  <li>Secondary memory used: Electrostatic tubes (internal), paper tape, punched card, magnetic tape.</li>
  <br>
  <li>A punched card, printing devices were used for input/output operations and store the result.</li>
  <br>
  <li>It occupied very large space, slow processing, inefficient, and unreliable due to low accuracy.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The power consumption was very high and it generated much heat. So, a special cooling system was required.</li>
  <br>
  <li>It could only perform straight forward simple numerical calculations.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The computers used to be much expensive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fg">
      These computers were used for scientific calculations and military applications. Although slow and unreliable, they laid the foundation for modern computing.
    </p>
<p class="fg">The first-generation computers marked the beginning of the computer age. They were mainly used for scientific calculations, military purposes, and solving mathematical problems. These computers relied heavily on vacuum tubes, which often burnt out and needed frequent replacement, making maintenance very difficult. Despite their limitations, they laid the foundation for modern computing technology.
Some notable first-generation computers include:</p>
<br>
<ul class="ulfg">

<li>ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer): Used by the U.S. Army for artillery calculations.</li>
<br>
<li>EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer): One of the first computers to use stored programs.</li>
<br>
<li>UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer): The first commercially produced computer in the U.S., used for business and government applications.</li>
<br>
<li>The first generation computers operated from 1940 to 1956 AD, marking an important era of innovation in computing history.</li>
</ul>
   

    <h2 class="fgh2">Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="fg">
      First generation computers marked the beginning of the digital revolution. Their limitations inspired the development of second generation computers using transistors.The first generation computers operated from 1940 to 1956 AD, marking an important era of innovation in computing history.
