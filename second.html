    <p class="fg">The second generation of electronic computers began with the development of the transistor (electronic switching device). A transistor transfers electric signals across a resistor. The three Bell Lab scientists, John Burdeen, Walter Brattain, and William Schockley, working for Bell Labs invented the transistor in 1947AD which won Nobel Prize in 1956 AD.
    </p>
    <p class="fg">Transistors were highly reliable compared to vacuum tubes. Transistors were far more superior in performance on account of their miniature size, smaller power consumption, and heat production rate. The second-generation computers used these semiconductor devices.</p>

    <h2 class="fgh2">Features of Second Generation Computers:</h2>
    <ul class="ulfg">
      <li>Technology used: Transistor</li>
      <br>
      <li>Operating speed was in terms of microseconds range.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Assembly language and machine-independent language (high level) such as COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) and FORTRAN (Formula Translation) were introduced to simplify programming.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Primary memory used: Magnetic core memory.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Secondary memory used: Magnetic drum and magnetic tape.</li>
      <br>
      <li>A punched card, printing devices were used for input/output operations.</li>
      <br>
      <li>They were compact and hence occupied less space. Transistor reduced the size of the computer. (a transistor is approx. 1/200th the size of the vacuum tube)</li>
      <br>
      <li>The power required to operate them was low.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The magnetic core was used as a primary and magnetic drum as secondary memory.</li>
      <br>
      <li>It was much faster, more reliable, better speed, and could handle an enormous amount of data than the first generation computers.</li>
      <br>
     <li>It could perform scientific calculations such as solving differential equations.</li>
     <br>
     <li>The Storage capacity and use of computers increased.</li>
    </ul>

     <p class="fg">The second generation marked a great improvement in computer design and efficiency. The use of transistors made computers faster, smaller, cheaper, and more reliable than the first-generation computers. These machines generated less heat and required less maintenance. Input and output devices such as printers, magnetic tape, and punched cards became more advanced.

     High-level programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN made programming easier and allowed more people to use computers for various purposes such as business, engineering, and scientific research. Computers could now process data in microseconds instead of milliseconds, which was a huge improvement.These computers were mainly used in universities, government offices, and large companies for payroll, record keeping, and data processing tasks. Examples of second-generation computers include IBM 1401, IBM 1620, UNIVAC 1108, and CDC 1604.

     

    <h2 class="fgh2">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="fg">Overall, the second generation of computers helped move computing from research labs to business and education, making it more practical and accessible. It laid the foundation for the next stage of computer evolution — the third generation using integrated circuits.</p>
