      Classification of generation of computer is mainly based on the basic devices used (technology) in a computer. Also the considerations are architecture, languages, modes of operation. The functions performed by computers and the speed of their operations have been changing since the old days to the most modern computers. There have been great variations in the size and cost of the computers. A technological break-through in hardware and software resulted in more and advanced computer systems. It has been identified that there are five major stages in the continuous development process of computers. These stages are called computer generations. In fact, a computer system belonging to one particular technological class is said to belong to a particular computer generation.

    <p class="fg">
      The first generation computer was the large mainframes built with valves. The smaller but more reliable computers built with transistors are called second-generation computers. And the computers made with silicon chips are the third generation computers. A real break-through came when the microprocessor chip appeared. The microprocessor-based computers are called fourth generation computers.
